**Cycloidal Gearboxes: Working Principle and Custom Design**

Cycloidal gearboxes are a class of speed reducers that use an eccentric-driven lobed disc to achieve high reduction ratios in a compact package. In a typical cycloidal reducer, the input shaft carries an eccentric bearing that drives a cycloidal disc so it “wobbles” against a fixed ring of pins or cams. The disc has a number of lobes L slightly fewer than the number of ring pins P, causing it to step relative to each pin as it orbits. Holes in the disc engage output rollers or pins that drive the output shaft. Because P > L, the output rotates in the opposite direction at a greatly reduced speed – roughly by the factor (P–L):L. For example, a 10-pin ring with a 9-lobe disc yields an input-to-output ratio of 9:1. Cycloidal drives differ fundamentally from conventional involute-gear systems (spur or helical gears) and even planetary gears. They transmit torque through rolling and sliding contact over multiple lobes simultaneously, yielding very high torque density for their size. Advantages include essentially zero backlash, high shock-load tolerance, and compactness. Single-stage cycloidal units can achieve very large reductions (e.g. >100:1) without multiple gear stages. In contrast, a single planetary stage is typically limited to ~3–10:1, requiring multiple stages for high ratios. Notably, one summary finds cycloidal drives offer higher reduction ratio, precision, and durability, as well as lower noise and maintenance, at the expense of lower peak torque capacity compared to planetary gearboxes

Common applications leverage these strengths: robotic actuators and servo drives (for compact high-torque precision)

**Design Objectives and Requirements**

The custom cycloidal gearbox was designed to meet specific performance and packaging goals. Primary objectives included high reduction ratio and torque capacity in a very compact form, with minimal backlash for precision motion. Durability and repeatability were also emphasized. For example, leveraging the inherent cycloidal strength, the design targeted transmitting maximal torque evenly through all lobes
